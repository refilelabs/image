# refilelabs/image

The `refilelabs/image` repository provides core utilities for image manipulation within the [**re;file labs**](https://refilelabs.com) platform. It offers robust, high-performance image processing features powered by WebAssembly (WASM) for secure, browser-based operations.

## Features

- **Image Conversion**: Convert images between various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, WebP).
- **Image Resizing and Cropping**: Resize or crop images to desired dimensions.
- **Metadata Editing**: View and edit metadata for supported image formats.
- **WebAssembly-Powered**: All operations run securely in the browser, leveraging WASM for speed and privacy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Rust**: For compiling WebAssembly components.
- **Nuxt**: Frontend framework to integrate with the broader **re;file labs** ecosystem.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/refilelabs/image.git
   cd image
   ```

2. Install dependencies (also builds WebAssembly modules):
   ```bash
   bun i
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

## Usage

### Components

If you want to use the image utility components in your own project, either include this nuxt layer using the [extends feature](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers#usage):
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
   'github:refilelabs/image',
  ]
})
```

### Programmatic Usage

In case you want to use the actual wasm modules in your project, you can import them directly from the [`@refilelabs/image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@refilelabs/image/v/next) package.
